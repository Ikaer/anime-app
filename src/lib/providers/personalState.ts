/**
 * Per-provider RAW personal state — the ONE place a provider's own slice shape
 * (`MALPersonalEntry`, `SimklPersonalEntry`, `AniListPersonalEntry`,
 * `LocalPersonalEntry`) is mapped onto the app's status/score/progress
 * vocabulary. Client-safe: model types only, no fs.
 *
 * Two consumers, one mapping — keep it that way. A provider added to only one of
 * them is hydrated but invisible to the comparison, or the reverse:
 *  - **Hydration** ([animeUtils.ts](animeUtils.ts) `toAnimeRecord`) narrows each
 *    state to `Partial<AnimePersonal>` via `toAnimePersonal` and runs the
 *    precedence merge over the result.
 *  - **Discrepancy** ([discrepancy.ts](discrepancy.ts) `computeDiscrepancy`)
 *    takes the states whole, because it needs the two fields hydration drops:
 *    `present` (does this provider hold an entry at all?) and `total` (that
 *    provider's OWN episode count, for the fully-watched reconciliation).
 *
 * `ProviderPersonalState` is a strict superset of `AnimePersonal`, which is what
 * lets one extractor feed both.
 *
 * `total` is deliberately not uniform: MAL and SIMKL carry their own episode
 * count, while AniList's personal entry and the local slice carry none and
 * borrow the catalog's. `present` is one question, but MAL answers it more
 * strictly than the rest — see `hasPersonalData`.
